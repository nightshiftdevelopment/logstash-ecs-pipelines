# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to the project!  Please read this guide first; our main objective is to ensure a stable code base so that the project is maintainable and easily understandable by future data engineers.


## Submitting Changes

  - Changes to code should always be done in a separate branch.
  - Once your branch is tested submit a pull request for a review.
  - In general you should never merge your own pull request.
  - When submitting a pull request, be sure to fully document and changes or additions made for the reviewer.
  - You are responsible for making sure any merge conflicts are resolved before your PR will be approved.
  - Commit messages should actually explain what you changed and did in a particular commit.
  - Fixing a bug fix? Make sure you link the commit to the original issue.


## Reporting Bugs

  - Use issues to report and track bugs.
  - Provide as much detail as possible and explain exactly what is not working by providing the expected behavior and the exact steps to reproduce the issue.


## Requesting New Features / Data Mappings

Please create an issue, tag it with "Feature Request", and provide as much detail as possible in your request.
